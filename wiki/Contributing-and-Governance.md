# Contributing and Governance

## Contribution Rules

- Keep changes scoped and verifiable.
- Update scripts, docs, and wiki together when behavior changes.
- Prefer deterministic install and validation patterns.
- Avoid destructive operations in shared branches.

## PR Checklist

- [ ] Platform install flow still works for touched files.
- [ ] Relevant dry-run command passes.
- [ ] Relevant health-check passes.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated under `[Unreleased]`.
- [ ] Wiki/docs links and commands are still valid.
