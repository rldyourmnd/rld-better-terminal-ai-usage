# Better Terminal Usage Wiki

This wiki is the operational playbook for `rld-better-terminal-ai-usage`.

## Scope

- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): production
- macOS: production
- Windows (PowerShell + WinGet): production

## Start Here

1. [Getting Started](Getting-Started)
2. [Platform Guide](Platform-Guide)
3. [Installation and Layers](Installation-and-Layers)
4. [Operations Runbook](Operations-Runbook)

## What Was Updated

- Linux installer hardening:
  - no direct installer `curl | sh` pattern in Linux scripts,
  - non-interactive APT behavior,
  - `cargo install --locked` for reproducible Rust CLI installs,
  - checksum-validation attempts for release archives where available.
- Linux flow smoke entrypoint: `./scripts/install.sh --dry-run`.
- Windows helper flags:
  - `./scripts/install.sh --help` in shell dispatch flow,
  - `-Help` for `install-windows.ps1` and `health-check-windows.ps1`.
- CI now includes Linux, macOS, and Windows smoke/parsing coverage.
