# Script Validation Report

This report captures static and operational validation for repository bootstrap scripts.

## Validation Timestamp

 - 2026-02-23T07:35:50+07:00

## Scope

Validated scripts:

- `scripts/install.sh`
- `scripts/install-foundation.sh`
- `scripts/install-layer-1.sh`
- `scripts/install-layer-2.sh`
- `scripts/install-layer-3.sh`
- `scripts/install-layer-4.sh`
- `scripts/install-layer-5.sh`
- `scripts/health-check.sh`

## Checks Performed

1. Shell syntax check (`bash -n scripts/*.sh`): PASS.
2. Fish syntax check (`fish -n configs/fish/config.fish`): PASS.
3. Shebang consistency (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`) on all scripts: PASS.
4. Strict mode check (`set -euo pipefail`) on all scripts: PASS.
5. Executable bit check (`chmod +x scripts/*.sh` and verify): PASS.
6. Runtime validation via `./scripts/health-check.sh --summary`: PASS (63 passed, 3 warnings, 0 hard failures).
7. Config parity check: FAIL (system files differ from repo templates):
   - `~/.wezterm.lua`
   - `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
   - `~/.config/starship.toml`

## Notes

- `shellcheck` is not installed on this machine, so shellcheck linting was not executed.
- Runtime end-to-end installation runs were not executed by default because scripts perform package installation and may require interactive `sudo` / network operations.
- Known runtime findings:
- `./scripts/health-check.sh --summary`: 63 passed, 3 warnings, 0 hard failures.
- Remaining warnings are config parity differences:
  - `~/.wezterm.lua`
  - `~/.config/fish/config.fish`
  - `~/.config/starship.toml`
