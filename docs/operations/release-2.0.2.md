# Release 2.0.2

Release date: 2026-02-23

## Highlights

- Fixed WezTerm status-bar runtime error causing high-frequency `update-status` failures and visible terminal lag.
- Root cause: passing `string.gsub` multiple return values directly into `table.insert`.
- Fix: keep only sanitized hostname value before insertion.
