### Disclosure Policy

## Security Best Practices

When using Awesome Terminal for AI:

1. **Review installation scripts** before running them
2. **Use sudo only when necessary** - our scripts only require sudo for system packages
3. **Keep tools updated** - run installation scripts periodically to update
4. **Review configuration files** before applying them to your system
5. **Report suspicious code** - if you find anything concerning, please report it
6. **Run strict health checks** after changes:
   - Linux: `./scripts/health-check.sh --strict --summary`
   - macOS: `./scripts/health-check-macos.sh --strict`
   - Windows: `.\scripts\health-check-windows.ps1 -Strict`

## Known Security Considerations

- Some tools require API keys (e.g., for cloud services)
- Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository
- Configuration files may contain sensitive paths - review before sharing
- Release downloads can fail integrity checks when upstream checksums are missing;
  prefer official release assets and documented checksum values when pinning.

Thank you for helping keep Awesome Terminal for AI secure! 🔐
