# v1.0.0 Manual Test Plan

## Purpose
Manual-only validation pack because CI отсутствует.

## Common environment
- Platforms: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Ubuntu 25.10, macOS.
- Modes: fish+starship, zsh fallback.
- Modes: cpu, gpu, auto.
- Build: release binary.
- Logging: debug mode enabled for tests.

## Preflight
1. Build and run `--help`.
2. Verify version string and config profile path.
3. Verify log directory writable.

## Functional tests

1) Shell bootstrap
- Start with default profile.
- Expected: fish shell with Starship prompt renders and is interactive.
- Fallback test: remove Starship init path and confirm zsh path selected.

2) Command palette
- Open `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`.
- Apply: `theme set cuberpunk`, `mode auto`, `shell zsh`, `render fps target 120`, `shell auto-init off`.
- Expected: immediate safe apply, history entry, fallback on invalid command.

3) Render modes
- Start in `mode cpu`, render simple workload.
- Start in `mode gpu`, render same workload.
- Start in `mode auto`, force GPU error and verify CPU fallback.
- Expected: shell continues, transition event logged, user notified.

4) Scrollback and output stability
- Print 20k+ lines and resize rapidly.
- Expected: no artifacts, no crash, scrollback cap and state remain coherent.

5) Resize storm
- Move window between 60Hz and 144Hz displays, perform rapid resizes.
- Expected: no panic, no freeze, no severe flicker.

6) Long-run stability
- Run sustained output for at least 30 minutes.
- Expected: no session-drop, bounded memory growth, no orphan child process.

7) Copy/paste and prompt integrity
- Run long prompt + multiline copy and paste.
- Expected: exact content preserved and prompt remains consistent.

8) AI session smoke
- Run a typical AI-tool command burst (no external service required).
- Expected: predictable input->paint pattern, no unexpected full redraw jitter.

9) Error handling smoke
- Simulate invalid PTY command and repeated resize after error.
- Expected: controlled message + retry/recover/degrade path, no uncontrolled crash.

## Release-readiness evidence
- Fill results per platform and mode.
- Attach logs for each failure injection case.
- Keep list of blockers and mitigations.
