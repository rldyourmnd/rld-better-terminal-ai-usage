# v1.0.0 Acceptance Matrix

## Purpose
Consolidated acceptance list for release criteria with explicit artifact links.

## A. Core Stability Acceptance

1. Base session behavior
- fish + starship starts and opens prompt.
- long-running AI-style session keeps terminal responsive for 1h test window.
- no session-drop under controlled resize/paste bursts.
- evidence: manual test entries in `planning/operations/v1.0.0-manual-test-plan.md`.

2. Renderer resilience
- auto mode prefers GPU and switches to CPU on recoverable GPU failure.
- GPU error transition is visible through `RenderModeTransition` event and user notification.
- shell session continues without restart during one GPU->CPU fallback.

3. Fault boundaries
- PTY, window, and render errors are converted to structured events.
- each error path has deterministic outcome: retry, degrade, or stop-with-message.

## B. AI Workflow Acceptance

1. Input/output stability
- prompt echo and redraw remain stable during command burst.
- copy/paste does not truncate and preserves content.
- scrollback remains correct after resize and terminal flush.

2. Performance perception
- no blocking repaint loops.
- no forced config restart for render/shell setting changes from command palette.

3. Startup behavior
- shell bootstrap is deterministic (fish path or zsh fallback).
- startup failures do not leave orphan sessions.

## C. Performance Acceptance

1. CPU mode
- stable rendering without GPU dependency.
- bounded work in idle (no busy waiting in hot path).

2. GPU mode
- normal workload does not repeatedly drop to fallback.
- frame pacing and resource transitions remain stable during screen frequency changes (60/120/144 Hz moves).

3. Memory and growth controls
- scrollback cap exists and enforced at 50_000 lines default.
- memory growth for base session remains bounded by configured caps and does not diverge during long-run manual smoke test.

## D. Delivery Acceptance

1. Versioning
- `1.0.0` committed in planning + metrics + release materials.

2. Documentation lock
- all referenced documents in `planning/v1.0.0-development-blueprint.md` are present and coherent.

3. Manual verification
- manual checks in `planning/operations/v1.0.0-manual-test-plan.md` completed with result notes.
- `planning/operations/v1.0.0-release-pack.md` signed off.

## D. External Integration Acceptance

1. Packaging
- GitHub release artifact path and installer script strategy documented.
- no apt/homebrew blockers in manual release notes.

2. Future OS support
- Windows architecture skeleton documented in `planning/stack/*` and excluded from v1.0 functional gates.
