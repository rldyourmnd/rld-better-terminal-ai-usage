## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- No unreleased changes yet.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Added a professional GitHub Wiki source tree under `wiki/` with Home, sidebar/footer, architecture, operations runbook, troubleshooting, security, and contribution pages.
- Added `scripts/publish-wiki.sh` for repeatable Wiki publication via `gh` with idempotent sync behavior.

### Changed
- Updated `README.md` to include Wiki discoverability and document the `wiki/` + publish workflow.
- Enhanced WezTerm UX by moving the tab bar to the bottom and adding a neon-pink left status signature (`rldyourmnd`).
- Refreshed runtime/context validation snapshots to reflect current project health-check state.

### Fixed
- Fixed Wiki publication sync to preserve cloned wiki git metadata (`.git`) during `rsync`, preventing false "already up to date" states.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- Removed user-specific hardcoded paths from Fish, WezTerm, and Starship config templates so installs work on any Linux user account.
- Switched Layer 1 `yq` install to user-local execution to reduce privileged-write failures on mixed environments.
- Main installer now reuses layer scripts end-to-end instead of maintaining duplicate install logic.
- Added production operations documentation set (`docs/operations/*`) and a full repository health-check script.
- Added live config parity and runtime anomaly validation (`context/system-state.md`, `context/script-validation.md`).
- Added architecture-aware manual install examples in Layer 3/4 docs (`layer-3-github.md`, `layer-4-code-intelligence.md`).
- Added authoritative tool inventory in operations docs (`docs/operations/terminal-tool-catalog.md`).
- Reordered `scripts/install.sh` to match documented installation order (Foundation first, then Layer 1-5).
- Expanded `scripts/health-check.sh` validation to include `tokei` and refreshed context run artifacts.
- Expanded `scripts/health-check.sh` parity/command checks by adding `grepai` and fixed `--summary`/`--strict` exit behavior in non-verbose mode.
- Expanded `scripts/health-check.sh` tool validation with `glow` to align with Layer 2 inventory.
- Updated `README` and `context/*` state snapshots with fresh validation baseline and diagnostics.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Cyberpunk prompt UI for `ultra-max` profile (neon cyan/pink palette)
- Full absolute repository path in prompt layout
- Canonical markdownlint configuration for repository-wide docs CI

### Changed
- AI stack prompt labels updated to `CL`, `GEM`, `CX`
- Install scripts now sync configs reliably from any working directory
- Foundation/full installer now applies `ultra-max` profile by default

### Fixed
- WezTerm/Starship icon alignment and fallback rendering behavior
- Markdown CI failures on docs and policy files
- README install and Layer 5 behavior consistency
