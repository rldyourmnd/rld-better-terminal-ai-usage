## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

For PRs that touch installation or runtime behavior, include output from:

```bash
bash -n scripts/*.sh
fish -n configs/fish/config.fish
./scripts/health-check.sh --summary
```

Platform-specific checks (when relevant):

- Linux flow smoke: `./scripts/install.sh --dry-run`
- macOS flow smoke: `./scripts/macos/install.sh --dry-run`
- Windows flow smoke: `.\scripts\install-windows.ps1 -DryRun`
- Windows health-check: `.\scripts\health-check-windows.ps1 -Summary`

If you changed tool versions or validation assumptions:

- update `context/system-state.md`
- update `context/script-validation.md`
- add a release note in `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`

# Use functions with clear names
install_tool() {
    # Implementation
}

# Logging pattern
log_info() { echo -e "[INFO] $1"; }
log_success() { echo -e "[SUCCESS] $1"; }

## 📊 Tool Evaluation Criteria

When suggesting new tools, consider these criteria:

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Performance | 40% | Benchmark scores and actual speed improvements |
| Developer Experience | 25% | Usability, documentation, learning curve |
| Documentation | 15% | Quality of official docs and community resources |
| Maintenance | 10% | Active development, recent releases |
| Community | 10% | Stars, forks, community size |

### Evaluation Process

1. **Research**: Check benchmarks, documentation, GitHub stars
2. **Test**: Install and use the tool in daily workflow
3. **Compare**: Evaluate against existing alternatives
4. **Document**: Add to appropriate layer with clear usage examples
